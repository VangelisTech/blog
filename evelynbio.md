AI Research Practitioner | Former Support Manager at Red Hat | Open Source Advocate | Machine Learning Evaluations

During the most exciting technical change of my career, the tidal wave of machine learning, especially open source models, I took a break from work to do self-directed research. I led a study group which focused on model architecture and agent collaboration. We read, in detail, more than 200 papers, and implemented many of the models. My skills at spotting an unsupported claim are finely honed.

Prior to this research focus, I managed global technical support teams at Red Hat, working with enterprise clients across multiple industries. Before that I founded an Open Source consulting and hosting company and ran it for many years. 

I bring a unique combination of deep technical AI knowledge and proven leadership experience. I'm now seeking opportunities in AI management, engineering leadership, or strategic roles where I can bridge the gap between cutting-edge ML technologies and practical business implementation.
