Agents simplify the interface between humans and computers. 

As a TPM, one of my most important responsibilities was to translate use-cases into technical requirements. I needed to not only understand my team's tech stack, but also how the users would interact with it, and how we would measure our success. 

It usually takes multiple conversations between business and engineering stakeholders to compose a PRD. Especially if you are the one building the backlog. This kind of planning and coordination can take weeks for small features, and months for epics or new products. 

Writing the backlog may start easy enough with a solid PRD, but there is an art to writing tasks that leave enough room for engineers to choose their implementation, but define enough constraints and test conditions that the end product actually solves the use-case in the first place. 

Along the way you are fighting internal politics across groups. Engineers typically loathe Product Managers, and the opposite is also true in most orgs. 

Let's say, by some miracle, you write the perfect PRD the first time, and you are best buds with all your engineers, with full commitment from all the dependent teams coordinated across programs. 

No one, not even your senior mentors, will understand the feature like you do. 

You can write all of the documentation in the world. 
You can communicate with the sophistication and grace of Maya Angelou.
You can coordinate meetings, and set up monitoring, define service level agreements, secure votes for chancellor of the senate.

Because you are "the guy". 
The primary contact point. 
The center of all dependencies. 

We don't need agents because they save us time, money, or breath for that matter. We need agents to help us manage the hundreds of dependencies we can't immediately memorize in our heads. And do you know what's really good at remembering things and resolving dependencies? Computers. 

Agents are just the interface by which we can delegate the understanding of complex systems to computers. Large Language Models gave us the power to speak to computers, so now it's a hell of a lot easier. 

Product Management isn't the only kind of job that has to deal with a lot of dependencies. Software Engineering is potentially one the most complex examples of working with dependencies.

As humans, we all struggle with dependency management because we have a finite cognitive load. We can only hold so many thoughts in our short-term memory. If we want to understand something that requires more than that threshold we must LEARN it. Or in other words, TRAIN our brains to materialize those neural networks into long term memory. 

So the next time you get frustrated because you don't understand something, delegate, take a break and let the computer help.
