Should you be so inclined to design a cognitive architecture for your AI Agent, I invite you to consider reviewing some of the incredible research that has been performed by the generations before us. 

To be blunt, the current popularized LLM Agent Paradigm is naive. There is nothing wrong with naive perspectives, just be aware that computational cognition is a more mature field than LangChain's ReAct Pattern. 

To catch up with the field I recommend starting with Cognitive Architectures from D. Vernon (2022) of Carnegie Mellon Africa which you can find here:

Vernon frequently references the comprehensive survey performed by Kotseruba and Tsotsos (2020) of York University in Toronto titled "40 Years of Cognitive Architectures: Core Cognitive Abilities and Practical Applications" found here:
