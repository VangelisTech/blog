### Beneftis of Open-Source Software Projects

**For companies acting as project stewards**, open-source software projects drive the standardization of processes by means of mass adoption. More adoption means a more mature feature set, more focus on security and robust testing, resulting in an all around more compelling piece of software.

**For contributors** from multiple companies come together, the developers enjoy more collaboration and transparency, without the burden of  which leads to wider adoption and stronger security. Last but not least, its great marketing to developers. They get the opportunity to try new tools, without needing to buy them. Developers also get practice working with professsional developers, on codebases at all levels of maturity in any programming language, to solve real world problems. The skills and relationships honed in these projects are invaluable to a developer's career.

**For Consumers**
Software you can try before you buy lets you test if it works in your environment to solve your problem. If it doesn't do what you want, you can open bug reports to tell the developers what happened, and what you hoped would happen. Your specific computing environment is likely different than the one the developers are using, so you expand the testing in the direction of your use case. This is a win-win for everyone.

Machine learning models are different than the average software project. They are very general purpose tools.  
To make it crystal clear, open source projects that become industry standard, become the bedrock for adoption. They form the first filter in the funnel through which downstream projects can
