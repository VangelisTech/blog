IBM's Competitive Strategy: Evelyn Mitchell viewed ACP as a strategic move by IBM to enhance their competitive advantage, building on their previous success with Gemini model indemnification to reduce customer apprehension and foster adoption within their ecosystem.  They believe this strategy is far more effective than those currently employed in California. Everett Kleven agreed, highlighting IBM's resilience and experience navigating business acquisitions and intellectual property challenges.

Evelyn Mitchell explained that IBM aims to protect enterprise customers from copyright infringement when using their Granite models, trained on public content.  However, Granite's compatibility with any internet tool through MCP prevents IBM from guaranteeing copyright protection, leading them to propose ACP with tool-specific access controls to limit model usage to a controlled environment (00:01:24).
Avoiding Complexity in Technology: Evelyn Mitchell highlighted the challenges of complexity in technology, including difficulties in auditing, logging, and maintenance, along with the need for specialized skill sets (00:02:44).  They argued that complexity should be hidden from average users, similar to how users don't need to understand the intricacies of their computer's BIOS or cell phone functionality

Challenges in Agent Development and Communication:  Mitchell highlighted the limitations of current agents, emphasizing that they lack sufficient grounding in the real world and struggle with handling complexity and exploring novel solutions (01:11:56). They pointed out that models often get stuck in loops and have difficulty overcoming biases in their training data, a challenge in communicating effectively with and directing them (01:13:24).  The need for clear communication in directing agents was also discussed, highlighting the limitations of human communication as a significant factor (01:11:56).
